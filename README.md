## Usage

- On Linux, the shebang line is `#! /usr/bin/python3`

### Running Python Programs with Assertions Disabled

You can disable the assert statements in your Python programs for a slight
performance improvement. When running Python from the terminal,
include the `-O` switch after python or python3 and before the name of the
`.py` file.

```sh
python ./script.py -O
```

This will run an optimized version of your program that skips the
assertion checks.
